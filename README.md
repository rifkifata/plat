## About

This project is useful for find out the area of origin of the vehicle when you first bought it, you just need to enter the area code at the front and at the end of the vehicle plate number that you want to search for. You can also use the Public API that we created for your application to consume **for free**. You can grab the data in `area.json` for free and put it into your database for reuse.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

As an Indonesian, I really understand how lazy we are and really like something that is free. so I created a Public API that you can access for free, and also I created an application that consumes this Public API that you can use as wisely.

### Rest Full API

1. Endpoint : `teuku.my.id`
2. Method : `POST`
3. Header :
4. Body :

   ```javascript
   {
   "areaCode" : "BL",
   "subAreaCode" : "Z"
   }
   ```

   in-case : **BL 00 N**
   \*nb :

   - areaCode is mandatory
   - subAreaCode is optional
   - areaCode is like **BL**
   - subAreaCode is **N**

"areaName": "Aceh",
"subAreaName": "Kota Banda Aceh",
"subAreaArr": [
    {
